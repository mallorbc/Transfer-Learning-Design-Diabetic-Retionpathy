# Diabetic-Retinopathy Kaggle

Repo that will be used to try to get working model for classify health problems after reading images of the eye

## Warning

The code here is the first time I wrote machine learning code from scratch.  There is A LOT I would change knowing what I know now.

## Use

Use the docker images to take care of all dependencies.  Inside of the docker image used the conda environment ```diabetic``` by running ```conda activate diabetic```

This program uses flags to run properly, to see what the flags are run ```python main.py -h```

## Data

Find the data for this repo [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tanlikesmath/diabetic-retinopathy-resized).  The data is already resized and cropped, so little more manpulation should need to be done
